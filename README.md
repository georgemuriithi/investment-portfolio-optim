An investment portfolio of stocks was created using LSTM stock price prediction and optimized weights. The performance of this portfolio was better compared to an equally weighted portfolio and a market capitalization-weighted portfolio.

***Disclaimer:** The LSTM model cannot be used to predict stock prices in real life, and this project cannot help an investor make investment decisions in the stock market. This is because the stock market is highly unpredictable. Prediction models do not work. In this project, the validation phase was used to test the model's performance. The purpose of the project was to implement Univariate Time-Series Prediction using LSTM.*

## Problem Description
The task was to create an investment portfolio from stocks that maximizes overall return.

### Data
**Top 30 U.S. companies by market capitalization** were used. The start time was **2009-12-31** and the end time was **2021-12-31.** AbbVie (ABBV), Meta (FB) and Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) were excluded because they were listed on the stock market after 2009-12-31.

The csv files and model states can be accessed from the *data* folder.

An investment portfolio of several stocks was created by making stock price predictions using an **LSTM Univariate Time-Series Prediction** model. Daily returns were then are computed from the predicted stock prices and used to get weights that maximize overall return. This was done using **SLSQP (Sequential Least SQuares Programming)** optimization.

To create the **features** of the LSTM model, a time step of **100 days** was used. This meant that if we consider today's Adj Close price as the **response,** the features will be the Adj Close prices of the past 100 days.

LSTM model **parameters:**

- `input_size=1`
- `hidden_size=1`
- `num_layers=1`
- `batch_first=True`
- `num_classes=1`
- `learning_rate=0.001`
- `optimizer=Adam`
- `loss_function=MSELoss()`
- `num_epochs=10000`

***GPU** was leveraged.*
