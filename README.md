An investment portfolio of stocks using LSTM stock price predictions and optimized weights. The performance of this portfolio is better compared to an equally weighted portfolio and a market capitalization weighted portfolio.

***Disclaimer:** The LSTM model cannot be used to predict stock prices and this project cannot help you make investment decisions in the stock market. The stock market is highly unpredictable, therefore, prediction models do not work. In this project, the validation phase is used for analysis. The purpose of this project is to implement Univariate Time-Series Prediction using LSTM.*
